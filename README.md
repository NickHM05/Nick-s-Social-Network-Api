# Nick's Social Network API

## Description
I wanted to build an API for a social network application so that users can share their thoughts online, share their thoughts with their friends, make new friends, and create even a list of friends. The routing was taken care of by using express. The database was made with MongoDB including the Mongo ODM. I had to use Moment.js to format the time for different events. The video will go over Insomnia since this application/api will not be deployed. I learned a lot more about how to start building this framework given that we did something similair with mysql but i felt like this time i had a better grasp on the subject.
